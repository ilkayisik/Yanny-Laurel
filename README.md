__Signal processing with YANNY and LAUREL __


This repository contains a jupyter notebook that loads 
- the famous Yanny-Laurel recording 
and 
- applies some some signal processing functions from Allen Downey's ThinkDSP Book
```Think DSP: Digital Signal Processing in Python, by Allen B. Downey.```

By applying a band pass filter and excluding certain frequencies from the recording I started to hear Laural instead of Yanny. 
Try it out!
